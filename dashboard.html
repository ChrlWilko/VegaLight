                <h2>Prices Across the Suburbs</h2>
                <p>
                    The map to right displays the median property prices for each suburb, highlighting the changes
                    of
                    value across the
                    Greater Melbourne area. As made evident in the graphic, properties to the east of the CBD (red
                    circle) generally
                    have a higher median price. The suburbs surrounding the bay also have recorded higher median
                    prices
                    compared
                    to northern and western suburbs. This comes as no surprise, due to Australians obsession with
                    the
                    beach and over
                    85% of our population living less than 1 hour from a beach (Wheeler, 2010); every street closer
                    to
                    the beach is a step in right direction.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most expensive suburb was <strong>Kooyong</strong>, just to the east of the CBD with a
                    median
                    property price of <span style="color: green;">$3,080,000</span>.
                    <br>
                    The most affordable suburb was <strong>Kurunjang</strong> in the west, hosting a median property
                    price of <span style="color: green;">$362,000</span>.

                <h2>Seasonal Buying Patterns</h2>
                <p> There are many factors that go into when a person will decide to buy property, and the
                    time of year is a crucial aspect that is rarely overlooked. The best time of year to buy
                    is not set in stone, with many people suggesting that spring or autumn time provide the
                    best opportunities (Inovayt, 2022). However, in Melbourne, this assumption does not
                    necessarily hold true, with the greatest number of properties being sold between <span
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 149);">May</span> through
                    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 149);">July</span>.

                <h2>Most Prominent Real Estate Agencies</h2>
                <p> In Melbourne there are over 400 different real estate agencies (Domain, 2016) all competing for the
                    sale of homes. Some
                    of these agencies are more profound and take up a larger share of the housing market. These agencies
                    also have holds
                    on certain regions and suburbs of Melbourne. As seen in the graphic to the right, the agency
                    <span style="color: purple;">Nelson</span> maintain the greatest total number of properties sold
                    across Melbourne,
                    however, in the suburb of Albert Park they rank as the lowest seller.

                <h2> Property Types Effect on the Number of Bedrooms, Price and Proximity to CBD over the Decades</h2>
                <p>The three main property categories in Australia are <span
                        style="color: rgb(43, 68, 96);">houses</span>,
                    townhouses and units. <span style="color: rgb(43, 68, 96);">Houses</span> are generally identified
                    as
                    seperated dwellings that come in all shapes and sizes. <span
                        style="color: rgb(43, 68, 96);">Houses</span>
                    are very popular in Australia, affording residents with privacy and flexibilty. A
                    <span style="color: rgb(245, 133, 24);">townhouses</span> is a multi-level building that allows
                    people to
                    own a house on a strata title; which means they own the building but share the land with others.
                    <span style="color: rgb(228, 87, 86);">Units</span> or apartments are self-contained living areas
                    that are part
                    of a larger building consisting of other units. (Realestate.com, 2022)
                    <br>
                    Most properties in Melbourne have between 2-4 bedrooms as the standard, with <span
                        style="color: rgb(228, 87, 86);">units</span>
                    generally having fewer and <span style="color: rgb(43, 68, 96);">houses</span> containing more.
                    Prior to the 1960's
                    most properties built were <span style="color: rgb(43, 68, 96);">houses</span>, but during the 60's
                    and 70's, a
                    boom in <span style="color: rgb(228, 87, 86);">units</span> being built can be seen. <span
                        style="color: rgb(245, 133, 24);">Townhouses</span>
                    only really began being built in larger numbers in the late 90's and early 2000's.
                    <br>
                    In the scatterplot below, the distance of a property is measured in kilometres from the Melbourne
                    CBD.
                    Unsurprisingly, <span style="color: rgb(228, 87, 86);">units</span> take up a large amount of the
                    area in the bottom left of the graphic,
                    showing their abundance in proximity to the city and greater affordability. <span
                        style="color: rgb(245, 133, 24);">Townhouses</span>
                    generally are seen a bit further from the city with a slight jump in price as well.
                    <br>
                    <span style="color: rgb(43, 68, 96);">Houses</span>
                    demonstrate the greatest range and number, with a strong correlation between distance and price. The
                    median price of living in a
                    <span style="color: rgb(43, 68, 96);">house</span> 3.0 km from the CBD in Middle Park, is $5.6
                    million. Comparatively,
                    the furthest distance from the CBD, 45.9 km in the suburb Gisborne,
                    has a median <span style="color: rgb(43, 68, 96);">house</span> price of $775,000.
